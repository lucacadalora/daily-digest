Bank Indonesia (BI) issued a dire warning this week: "China's strategic mineral export curbs are destabilizing Indonesia's industrial backbone", as Beijing escalates its trade war retaliation against the West. Following President Trump's 25% tariffs on Chinese EVs and renewables, China has weaponized its dominance in critical minerals, restricting exports of tungsten, molybdenum, indium, and graphite ‚Äî key inputs for defense tech, batteries, and electronics. Indonesia, reliant on Chinese refining expertise and mineral imports, now faces a supply chain crisis threatening its nickel ambitions and IHSG stability.

Mechanism: How China's Mineral War Targets Indonesia
1. China's Export Controls Redirect Supply Chain Chaos
The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on Chinese clean tech forced Beijing to retaliate with strategic mineral export curbs, disrupting global supply chains. Indonesia, home to 23% of global nickel reserves, relies on Chinese firms (e.g., Tsingshan, GEM Co.) to process 92% of its nickel into battery-grade materials. With China halting exports of tungsten (critical for alloy production) and molybdenum (used in steel), Indonesian smelters like ANTM and INCO face production paralysis.

Impact:
Nickel Price Crash: Global nickel prices slumped to $15,400/ton (near 4-year lows) as Chinese buyers withhold orders.
Smelter Shutdowns: PT Virtue Dragon's $1.2B nickel plant halted operations, laying off 2,100 workers.

2. Price Manipulation and Market Capture
Chinese firms exploit Indonesia's reliance on their refining technology to suppress prices and dominate supply chains:
Oligopsony Tactics: Chinese buyers collude to purchase nickel ore at $28/ton (vs. global $42/ton), squeezing margins for ADRO and PTBA.
Tech Dependence: China controls 85% of Indonesia's high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) technology, critical for EV battery production.
Example: PT Trimegah Bangun Persada (ANTM) reported Q4 2024 losses of $120M after China slashed nickel orders by 40%.

3. Policy Paralysis Amid Crisis
Jakarta's countermeasures remain fragmented:
Export Ban Delays: A proposed 2025 ban on raw nickel exports (to boost domestic refining) stalled due to lobbying by Chinese-backed firms.
BI's Dilemma: With USDIDR at 16,450, BI's Feb 11 emergency meeting may hike rates 25bps to 6.00%, but this risks stifling growth.`
