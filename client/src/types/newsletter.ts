A liquidity deficit in the banking system‚Äîreflected in a Net Bank Balance (NBB) of -1.70% of GDP‚Äîdrove a 4.4% Rupiah depreciation in 2024, raising costs for importers and threatening inflation. Enter PP No 8 2025, a bold regulation effective March 1, 2025, mandating 100% repatriation of commodity export proceeds for 12 months. With potential inflows of USD 50 billion, this could reshape liquidity and stabilize the Rupiah."

Key insights:\n\nMechanism: Trump's 10% China tariffs have redirected $48B worth of Chinese exports (textiles, electronics, ceramics) to ASEAN markets. Indonesia, with its porous import controls, absorbed 32% of this diverted volume.\n\nImpact: Local MSMEs face existential risks. Textile producers like ERAT (-18% WoW) and ceramic firm ARTI (-23%) collapsed as Chinese imports undercut prices by 40‚Äì60%.\n\nPolicy Paralysis: Indonesia's retaliatory 200% tariffs on Chinese goods (announced Jan 2025) remain unimplemented, exposing regulatory inertia.\n\nDefensive Pivot - Strategic Plan\n\nDividend Shelter: Rotate into HMSP (8.2% yield) and SMGR (6.7%).\n\nHMSP:\nShort-Term Play: High yield attractive for income, but monitor payout sustainability.\nAction: Buy on dips near Rp580 (52-week low) with tight stop-loss at Rp550.\n\nSMGR:\nLong-Term Value: Undervalued at 0.5x P/S, but await infrastructure policy clarity.\nAction: Accumulate below Rp2,700 (near 2025 low) for dividend + potential rebound."
