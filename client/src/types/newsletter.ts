The New Narrative: Indonesia as a Chinese Surplus Dumping Ground
Bank Indonesia (BI) issued a stark warning this week: "Chinese goods barred from US markets are flooding Indonesia," threatening to overwhelm domestic industries. Key insights:

Mechanism: Trump's 10% China tariffs have redirected $48B worth of Chinese exports (textiles, electronics, ceramics) to ASEAN markets. Indonesia, with its porous import controls, absorbed 32% of this diverted volume.

Impact: Local MSMEs face existential risks. Textile producers like ERAT (-18% WoW) and ceramic firm ARTI (-23%) collapsed as Chinese imports undercut prices by 40‚Äì60%.

Policy Paralysis: Indonesia's retaliatory 200% tariffs on Chinese goods (announced Jan 2025) remain unimplemented, exposing regulatory inertia.

Defensive Pivot - Strategic Plan

Dividend Shelter: Rotate into HMSP (8.2% yield) and SMGR (6.7%).

HMSP:
Short-Term Play: High yield attractive for income, but monitor payout sustainability.
Action: Buy on dips near Rp580 (52-week low) with tight stop-loss at Rp550.

SMGR:
Long-Term Value: Undervalued at 0.5x P/S, but await infrastructure policy clarity.
Action: Accumulate below Rp2,700 (near 2025 low) for dividend + potential rebound.`
