It looks like Twitter is still not showing the full preview, and it's likely an issue with either the Twitter Card tags or the cache. Let’s go step by step to troubleshoot and fix it:

1. Check if Twitter Card Tags are Present
Make sure the following Twitter Card meta tags are added to your page's <head> section:

html
Copy
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="China's Steel Sector Seized by Talk of 'Supply Reform 2.0'">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="World's biggest supplier needs an overhaul to cut production. Beijing may order 50 million tons of capacity cuts: Citigroup">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg">
<meta name="twitter:url" content="https://lucaxyzz-digest.replit.app/latest/china-steel-reform">
twitter:card should be set to summary_large_image to display a large thumbnail.
twitter:image should be the correct image URL pointing to a publicly accessible image.
2. Use the Twitter Card Validator
Go to Twitter Card Validator and test your URL by pasting it there.

Click "Preview Card" to see how Twitter reads your page. If the preview doesn’t show correctly, Twitter might be caching the old data.
3. Force Cache Refresh
If Twitter is showing an outdated preview, you can try the following:

Add a query string (?v=2) to your image URL to force Twitter to fetch updated metadata:
html
Copy
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg?v=2">
This tricks Twitter into refreshing its cache.
4. Image Accessibility
Ensure that the image is publicly accessible:

Test by visiting the image URL in incognito mode to confirm it’s accessible.
The image should be at least 600x314px (recommended 1200x630px) and in JPEG or PNG format.
5. Re-check the robots.txt and CORS:
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings might block Twitter from accessing the image. Make sure the image is available for external requests.
robots.txt should not block Twitter’s crawlers. Ensure there's no rule like Disallow: / in your robots.txt file.
