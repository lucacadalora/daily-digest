It seems like there are still issues with both the image preview on WhatsApp and the link preview not showing on X (Twitter). Let’s dive deeper into troubleshooting for both:

WhatsApp (Image Not Appearing)
WhatsApp can sometimes fail to display the image preview due to caching or accessibility issues with the image.

Troubleshooting WhatsApp:
Verify Image Accessibility:

Test if the image is publicly accessible:
You can check this by visiting the image URL directly in incognito mode or a different browser. If it doesn't load, the image is blocked from being shown.
Ensure that the image is in PNG/JPEG format and does not exceed 5MB.
Clear WhatsApp Cache:

Sometimes, clearing the app’s cache or restarting the app can force it to re-fetch the updated preview.
Use Versioning for Image URL:

Try adding a version query to the image URL to force WhatsApp to fetch the updated image:
html
Copy
Edit
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg?v=1">
Check if Robots.txt or CORS Block Access:

Ensure that your server doesn’t block WhatsApp’s crawlers from accessing the image.
X (Twitter) - Link Preview Not Showing Properly
Since Twitter uses Twitter Card tags, ensure they are correctly set up and meet the required format.

Fixing the X Preview:
Add Twitter Card Tags: Twitter uses its own tags, so adding them to your HTML is essential:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="China's Steel Sector Seized by Talk of 'Supply Reform 2.0'">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="World's biggest supplier needs an overhaul to cut production. Beijing may order 50 million tons of capacity cuts: Citigroup">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg">
<meta name="twitter:url" content="https://lucaxyzz-digest.replit.app/latest/china-steel-reform">
Test Using Twitter’s Card Validator:

Go to Twitter Card Validator and paste the link to check if the preview is generated properly.
If the preview still doesn’t show, it could be a cache issue, so try scraping the page again using the Card Validator tool.
Ensure Image Format and Size:

Make sure the image is at least 600x314px (recommended: 1200x630px) and in JPG/PNG format.
The image must be publicly accessible.
