The Floodgates Open
Bank Indonesia (BI) issued a dire warning this week: “China’s strategic mineral export curbs are destabilizing Indonesia’s industrial backbone”, as Beijing escalates its trade war retaliation against the West. Following President Trump’s 25% tariffs on Chinese EVs and renewables, China has weaponized its dominance in critical minerals, restricting exports of tungsten, molybdenum, indium, and graphite — key inputs for defense tech, batteries, and electronics. Indonesia, reliant on Chinese refining expertise and mineral imports, now faces a supply chain crisis threatening its nickel ambitions and IHSG stability.
Mechanism: How China’s Mineral War Targets Indonesia
1. China’s Export Controls Redirect Supply Chain Chaos
The Trump administration’s 25% tariffs on Chinese clean tech forced Beijing to retaliate with strategic mineral export curbs, disrupting global supply chains. Indonesia, home to 23% of global nickel reserves, relies on Chinese firms (e.g., Tsingshan, GEM Co.) to process 92% of its nickel into battery-grade materials. With China halting exports of tungsten (critical for alloy production) and molybdenum (used in steel), Indonesian smelters like ANTM and INCO face production paralysis.
Impact:
Nickel Price Crash: Global nickel prices slumped to $15,400/ton (near 4-year lows) as Chinese buyers withhold orders.
Smelter Shutdowns: PT Virtue Dragon’s $1.2B nickel plant halted operations, laying off 2,100 workers.
2. Price Manipulation and Market Capture
Chinese firms exploit Indonesia’s reliance on their refining technology to suppress prices and dominate supply chains:
Oligopsony Tactics: Chinese buyers collude to purchase nickel ore at $28/ton (vs. global $42/ton), squeezing margins for ADRO and PTBA.
Tech Dependence: China controls 85% of Indonesia’s high-pressure acid leaching (HPAL) technology, critical for EV battery production.
Example: PT Trimegah Bangun Persada (ANTM) reported Q4 2024 losses of $120M after China slashed nickel orders by 40%.
3. Policy Paralysis Amid Crisis
Jakarta’s countermeasures remain fragmented:
Export Ban Delays: A proposed 2025 ban on raw nickel exports (to boost domestic refining) stalled due to lobbying by Chinese-backed firms.
BI’s Dilemma: With USDIDR at 16,450, BI’s Feb 11 emergency meeting may hike rates 25bps to 6.00%, but this risks stifling growth.
