Global Coal's Price Slump Masks Brewing Supply Crisis and Potential Price Surge
March 3, 2025
Today's depressed coal prices conceal a brewing market tension that few analysts are discussing. Australian thermal coal contracts, the benchmark for Asia, have fallen to around $100 a ton â€“ returning to price levels not seen since May 2021, before Russia's invasion of Ukraine upended global energy markets.
While producers struggle and critics celebrate coal's apparent decline, underlying market dynamics suggest this downturn may be short-lived. A critical mismatch between investment patterns and demand trends is setting the stage for potential market tightness.

Investment Retreat vs. Stubborn Demand
Investment in new coal production has collapsed as shareholders and banks increasingly reject funding for new projects. Environmental concerns and fears of "stranded assets" have made financing virtually impossible across much of the industry.
"In previous price highs, that would've stimulated or incentivized a lot of new projects," said Steve Hulton, senior vice president of coal markets at Rystad Energy. "We haven't seen any of that happen. And we saw more players took the opportunity to actually exit stakes."
Even when prices spiked dramatically in 2022 during Europe's scramble for energy alternatives after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, producers remained reluctant to develop new mines:

Only 10 of 70 nations tracked by Global Energy Monitor plan to boost output by more than 10 million tons
76% of proposed new thermal coal projects (1.8 billion metric tons per year) are concentrated in just China and India
Most countries have abandoned new mine development entirely
Financial institutions have drastically reduced coal lending

Demand Defies Green Transition Expectations
Despite rapid renewable energy expansion, coal consumption continues to exceed forecasts. The International Energy Agency has been forced to revise its coal demand outlook higher in its last four annual reports and has reversed its previous position that demand had peaked.
Several factors are driving persistent demand:

Continued electrification in developing economies
Exploding data center requirements for AI and cloud computing
Extended operational life of coal plants in the US, Japan and Germany
Sustained industrial energy needs in emerging markets

India's coal consumption is projected to reach 1.5 billion tons by March 2030 (growing about 3% annually), according to the country's coal ministry. China, consuming half the world's coal, continues to see demand increases, with the IEA projecting a 1.3% rise through 2027.
Current Surplus: A Temporary Phenomenon
Today's low prices reflect several short-term factors:

Unusually mild winter across key Asian markets
Excessive inventory buildup by Chinese coal companies following 2021-2022 shortages
Temporary industrial demand weakness

China Coal Resource reports total Chinese coal inventories reached 665 million tons by December's end, a 21% year-over-year increase and sufficient to supply the nation for more than a month. Major players including China Shenhua Energy Co. have suspended foreign coal purchases while working to reduce port stockpiles.
Industry Strategists Bet on Coal's Staying Power
"A lot of our minority joint venture partners around the world, more particularly in Australia, wanted to get out of steam coal," Gary Nagle, CEO of Glencore Plc explained during a recent earnings call, discussing his company's ongoing commitment to coal. "At the time, coal was a four-letter word. It seems in today's world, coal is no longer a four-letter word."
Wood Mackenzie analyst Rory Simington argues the supply constraints and resulting price volatility indicate "a turbulent endgame for coal" rather than a gradual decline.
With Newcastle coal prices at current levels, approximately 10% of export mines are operating below profitability at prices under $110 a ton. These operations will likely reduce or suspend output, providing some price support.
Outlook: Preparing for Price Recovery
The combination of limited supply growth and persistent demand signals a potential sharp rebound for internationally traded coal that could:

Increase energy costs for households and manufacturers in developing economies
Extend coal's profitability timeline beyond current expectations
Complicate climate targets and emission reduction plans
Accelerate demand destruction in price-sensitive regions

"Structurally there are pressures, no doubt about it," Simington noted. "But to date, the overall growth of energy demand has meant consumption of coal keeps being able to grow."
