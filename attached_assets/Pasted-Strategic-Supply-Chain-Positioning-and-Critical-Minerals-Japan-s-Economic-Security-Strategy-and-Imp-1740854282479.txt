Strategic Supply Chain Positioning and Critical Minerals: Japan's Economic Security Strategy and Implications for Indonesia
Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Japan's Economic Security Framework
As meticulously documented by Armstrong, Solís, and Urata in their 2025 paper "Economic Security and New Industrial Policy" published in the Asian Economic Policy Review, Japan exhibits persistent vulnerabilities in its supply chain resilience despite comprehensive policy initiatives. The authors' empirical analysis reveals Japan's increased dependence on China for rare earth elements—rising precipitously from 50% in 2014 to 70% in 2022—notwithstanding Beijing's tightening export controls over strategic minerals including germanium, gallium, graphite, and antimony.
This vulnerability is systematically quantified through comparative analysis of supplier concentration metrics. Japan reports substantially higher supplier concentration (defined by Herfindahl-Hirschman Index above 50) compared to G7 averages across multiple critical sectors:

Machinery: Japan 148 vs. G7 12
Organic chemical goods: Japan 141 vs. G7 30
Rare earths and metals: Japan 86 vs. G7 12
Electric products: Japan 79 vs. G7 12

According to the Mitsubishi Research Institute's analysis cited in the paper, computation of import sources for ten specified critical materials designated under the Economic Security Promotion Act (ESPA) reveals China's dominant position across multiple categories. China represents the primary source of imports for fertilizers (42%), machine tools and industrial robots (30%), rechargeable batteries (52%), and ship parts (22%). Additionally, China ranks second in permanent magnets (36%), semiconductors and integrated circuits (16%), and metallic minerals (13%).
The authors further highlight the International Energy Agency's assessment that China maintains an extraordinary dominance in processing critical minerals, accounting for 70% of global rare earth elements production and an overwhelming 90% of processing capacity—a bottleneck of particular strategic concern.
Japan's Strategic Responses and Policy Implementation
Japan's response to these supply chain vulnerabilities is multifaceted, comprising both defensive mechanisms and proactive industrial policies:

The Economic Security Promotion Act (ESPA) establishes supply chain resilience as its first pillar, with specific provisions for government identification of essential products susceptible to foreign exploitation and subsidization of corporate sustainability planning.
Japanese firms' survey responses indicate implementation of varied supply chain risk management strategies:

Inventory buffer enhancement: 58.2% (semiconductors), 51.3% (critical minerals)
Production site/procurement source diversification: 50.9%, 53.9%
Product design reconfiguration: 30.9%, 17.9%
Material recycling initiatives: 10.0%, 14.1%


According to JCCI survey data analyzed in the paper, Japanese firms are pursuing diverse supply chain reconfiguration strategies:

"Friendshoring" (27.5%)
Reshoring to Japan (32.6%)
Further globalization (30.5%)

Indonesia's Strategic Position in Japan's Economic Security Framework
Indonesia's resource endowments and manufacturing capacity position it advantageously within Japan's evolving economic security strategy:
Critical Minerals Resources as Strategic Leverage
Indonesia's abundant nickel reserves—containing approximately 21% of global reserves—represent a significant opportunity within Japan's supply chain diversification imperative. As Armstrong, Solís, and Urata document Japan's increased rare earth dependence on China (from 50% in 2014 to 70% in 2022), Indonesia emerges as a potential alternative supplier in Japan's mineral security strategy.
The authors' identification of Japan's persistent vulnerabilities in rare earths and metals (HHI concentration index of 86 compared to G7 average of 12) creates strategic openings for Indonesia to position itself within Japan's "strategic autonomy" framework. This alignment is particularly relevant given Beijing's documented tightening of export controls over strategic minerals including germanium, gallium, graphite, and antimony.
Manufacturing Diversification and Supply Chain Reconfiguration
The paper's empirical analysis of Japanese corporate survey data indicating significant pursuit of "friendshoring" (27.5%) and "further globalization" (30.5%) strategies suggests Indonesia's potential as a destination for Japanese manufacturing investment seeking to reduce concentration risks. This opportunity is amplified by the authors' documentation of Japan's concerns regarding overdependence on China for products including:

Laptop PCs (99.4%)
Mobile telephones (83.7%)
Photovoltaic semiconductor devices (66.6%)
Lithium-ion batteries (66.1%)

Japan's Strategic Dependency Reduction from China
Armstrong, Solís, and Urata's analysis reveals Japan's systematic policy orientation toward reducing strategic dependency on China, encapsulated in the LDP's 2020 conceptualization of "strategic autonomy." This dependency reduction imperative is manifested concretely in investment trends, as evidenced by the pronounced decline in Japan's FDI flows to China. The paper documents the precipitous decrease from peak investment levels of 18.9% of total Japanese outflows in 2004 to a mere 2.1% in 2023, while Japan's outward FDI stock in China similarly contracted from 9% in 2012 to 6.4% by 2023.

This deliberate strategic recalibration, according to the authors, stems from a confluence of factors including China's diminishing growth trajectory, increasing wage structures, and most significantly, the intensification of geopolitical tensions. The paper specifically references the Japan Bank for International Cooperation's 2023 assessment that China is "losing attractiveness as a FDI destination," signaling a structural rather than cyclical shift in investment patterns. This reorientation creates substantial opportunities for alternative investment destinations like Indonesia that can offer complementary advantages while mitigating the concentration risks that Japanese economic security policy explicitly seeks to address.
Raw Materials Processing Advancement Opportunities
Perhaps most significantly, Armstrong, Solís, and Urata's analysis of China's dominance in critical minerals processing (90% of rare earths processing globally according to IEA data) illuminates a strategic convergence between Japan's economic security objectives and Indonesia's downstream industry development goals. The paper's documentation of Japan's substantial industrial subsidies (3.9 trillion yen over three years) suggests potential for Indonesia to attract Japanese technical expertise for advancing processing capabilities that would simultaneously serve Japan's strategic autonomy objectives.
This potential alignment is reinforced by the authors' identification of recent literature suggesting efficacy of well-designed industrial policies particularly for upstream sectors. Indonesia's position in the industrial value chain for critical minerals essential to clean energy technologies corresponds directly with Japan's identification of renewable energy components as strategically important under the Economic Security Promotion Act (ESPA).
Implementation Considerations and Institutional Architecture
Realizing Indonesia's strategic potential within Japan's economic security framework requires attention to several implementation dimensions highlighted in the paper:

Institutional Framework Development: The authors' documentation of Japan's rapid institutional formalization—including dedicated economic security divisions within MOFA and METI, specialized teams within the National Security Secretariat, and a full-fledged Economic Security Bureau—provides models for Indonesia to develop complementary institutional capacities.
Public-Private Coordination: The paper's finding of significant divergence in economic security implementation based on organizational scale (56.5% of SMEs have implemented no economic security policies) parallels challenges in Indonesia's business ecosystem, suggesting potential for shared capacity-building initiatives.
Multilateral Framework Alignment: Japan's systematic embedding of its economic security agenda within frameworks including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework's Supply Chain Resilience pillar creates opportunities for Indonesia to strengthen economic security cooperation through established multilateral channels.

The analytical framework presented in Armstrong, Solís, and Urata's paper provides sophisticated guidance for Indonesia to strategically position itself within Japan's evolving economic security architecture, particularly in critical minerals and supply chain reconfiguration initiatives that align with both nations' strategic imperatives amid intensifying geopolitical competition.
