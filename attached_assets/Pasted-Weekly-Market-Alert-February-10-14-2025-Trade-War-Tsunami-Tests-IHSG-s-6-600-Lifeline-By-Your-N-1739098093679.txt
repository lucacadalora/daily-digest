By [Your Name/Team]
Backward Analysis: Validated Risks
Previous Report
Our February 3–7 analysis accurately flagged:
IHSG Collapse: Index plunged to 6,752.57 (-5.16% WoW), breaching 6,900 as projected.
Commodity Carnage: ADRO (-12%), PTBA (-9%), and AALI (-8%) collapsed amid China’s coal/LNG tariffs and CPO risks.
Currency Pressures: USDIDR hit 16,450, nearing BI’s intervention threshold.
Key Triggers:
China’s 15% tariff on US coal/LNG (effective Feb 10) disrupted Indonesia’s $2.1B nickel supply chain15.
Trump’s 10% China tariffs triggered Rp 3.8T foreign equity outflows611.
MSCI exclusion of BREN/CUAN/PTRO erased $10.5B market cap, amplifying IHSG volatility625.
Key Narratives for February 10–14
1. GDP Growth Reality Check
Indonesia’s 2024 GDP growth of 5.03% YoY masked structural risks:
Inventory-Driven: 1.2pp growth came from stockpiling, not organic demand25.
Consumption Slump: Private consumption grew 4.83% (vs 5.1% in 2023), signaling weakening purchasing power25.
Outlook: 2025 growth may stall at 5.0–5.1% unless exports rebound25.
2. Trade War Escalation
New Fronts Opening:
Risk	Impact on Indonesia	Source
China’s rare earth export curbs (effective Feb 12)	Disrupts $2.1B nickel exports to China, hitting smelters like ANTM, INCO	527
US 15% ASEAN auto tariffs (proposed)	ASII (-14% WoW) faces margin compression; 30% of revenue at risk	314
Flooded Markets: BI warns Chinese goods diverted from US could “swamp” Indonesia, pressuring UNVR, ICBP	34	
Macro Impact:
USDIDR could test 16,800 if Trump expands tariffs to ASEAN410.
BI’s reserves ($138.6B) may dip below 6 months’ import cover610.
Sectoral Outlook
High-Risk Zones
Sector	Vulnerability	Key Stocks
Energy	China’s coal import quotas (-40% MoM)	ADRO, PTBA
Automotive	US tariff retaliation risk	ASII, AIMS
Tech	Rare earth supply chain disruption	INCO, ANTM
Defensive Pivot
Sector	Catalyst	Key Stocks
Healthcare	Pandemic restocking demand	KLBF, SIDO
Gold	Safe-haven demand at $2,885/oz	MDKA, ANTM
Telcos	5G rollout shields earnings	TLKM, EXCL
Critical Thresholds
IHSG Support: 6,600–6,700 (Fibonacci 78.6% retracement).
Resistance: 6,900–7,000 (previous support now ceiling).
Black Swan: Breach below 6,600 triggers algo sell programs targeting 6,4003135.
Investor Action Plan
Rotate to Domestic Demand: Increase exposure to BBCA (loan growth +24% YoY) and HMSP (8.2% yield).
Hedge USDIDR: Use BI’s FX Swap Facility (7.1% yield) or gold proxies.
Avoid Value Traps: Exit BREN/CUAN/PTRO until MSCI liquidity stabilizes.
Bottom Line
The IHSG’s 6,600 level is this week’s litmus test. While systemic risks dominate, three factors could spark rebounds:
BI Rate Hike (Feb 11): 25bps increase to stabilize USDIDR.
China’s Policy Easing: Potential RRR cuts to offset trade war impacts.
Ramadan Prep: Consumer stocks (ICBP, UNVR) may rally on pre-holiday demand.
Trade War Playbook: Short ASII/Long TLKM (1:2 beta) for sectoral hedge.
