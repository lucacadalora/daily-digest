China's Steel Sector: 'Supply Reform 2.0' Looms
February 28, 2025
China's billion-ton steel industry appears headed for its biggest restructuring in a decade. Speculation is growing that Beijing will order plant closures of around 50 million tons, possibly as early as next week's National People's Congress.
An unverified screenshot suggesting government approval of capacity cuts went viral on China's WeChat this week, driving up steel prices and steelmaker stocks. While no official plans have been announced, the industry widely acknowledges the need for another round of supply-side reforms, nearly a decade after President Xi Jinping's first intervention.

The country's chronic property crisis has pushed domestic steel demand down for four consecutive years. Meanwhile, the international environment has grown increasingly hostile as nations move to block China's export flood, which topped 110 million tons last year.
"We understand the policy stance on steel has changed at the Politburo level and more actions will follow to reduce supply," Jack Shang, a Citigroup Inc. analyst wrote. "It's time for a supply reform 2.0."
The sector operated in the red for most of 2024, with debt climbing to record highs and an unprecedented number of companies reporting losses. Alternative demand sources like manufacturing, green infrastructure, and shipbuilding haven't been sufficient to offset the decline.

Trade tensions are intensifying:

Over 30 new trade cases launched against Chinese steel in 2024
US maintaining Trump's 25% tariffs
South Korea and Vietnam implementing new tariffs
EU revamping safeguards; India considering tougher measures

During the previous reform period (2016-2019), China eliminated 150 million tons of capacity. According to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, the country would need to cut another 150 million tons of coal-fired blast furnace capacity to meet its climate targets.
Citigroup analysts suggest new measures would target smaller, inefficient companies while benefiting industry giants like China Baowu Steel Group and Ansteel Group. "China's supply-side reforms have always targeted smaller, less efficient companies," confirms Sabrin Chowdhury, head of commodities at BMI. "This works to consolidate the industry and benefit larger, more efficient state-owned enterprises."
All eyes are now on the National People's Congress next week for potential policy announcements in this final year of China's current Five-Year Plan.
