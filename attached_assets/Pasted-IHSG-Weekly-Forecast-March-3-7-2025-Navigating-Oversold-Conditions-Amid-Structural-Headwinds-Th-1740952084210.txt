IHSG Weekly Forecast (March 3-7, 2025): Navigating Oversold Conditions Amid Structural Headwinds
The IHSG enters March 2025 at a critical inflection point after a historic 7.83% weekly decline to 6,270.597, its lowest close since October 2021. Foreign investors drove the sell-off, with Rp10.22 trillion in net outflows last week alone (Rp18.98 trillion YTD), exacerbated by MSCI’s reweighting of Indonesia from 2.2% to 1.5% in its EM index1710. While technical indicators signal oversold conditions, structural pressures from global trade risks and domestic liquidity constraints complicate rebound prospects.
Key Drivers for the Week Ahead
1.	MSCI Rebalancing Fallout (Effective March 3):
•	The reduction in Indonesia’s weighting forces passive fund outflows of ~$120 million, disproportionately affecting large caps like BBCA, BBRI, and BMRI49.
•	Stocks added to MSCI Small Cap (MDKA, INKP, CLEO) may see volatility as active funds reposition12.
2.	Technical Positioning:
•	Oversold Signals: RSI (41.16) and Stochastic RSI hint at exhaustion, but MACD’s bearish slope suggests lingering downside risk1011.
•	Critical Levels:
•	Support: 6,050–6,200 (2021 lows); breach risks test of 5,900.
•	Resistance: 6,450 (MA20) and 6,640 (Feb 21 close)1011.
3.	Global Sentiment Risks:
•	Trump’s tariff threats against Mexico/Canada and Fed policy uncertainty keep risk assets under pressure. The USDIDR nearing 16,500 raises intervention risks713.
Sector & Stock Spotlight
•	Big-Cap Bloodbath:
•	BREN (-25.61% YTD) and BMRI (-10.96%) face continued foreign selling due to MSCI adjustments910.
•	Tech Outliers: The sector (+59.31% YTD) remains resilient (e.g., INET +34.48% last week) but may lack liquidity to offset broader declines39.
•	Rebound Candidates:
•	TLKM and BBNI: Oversold blue chips with dividend yields >4%; technical basing patterns observed610.
•	ANTM: Leverages gold’s safe-haven appeal ($2,885/oz) and BI’s potential rate hikes1013.

Macro Catalysts to Watch
•	March 3: February inflation data (expected 0.5% YoY vs. 0.76% prior) – benign print may ease BI pressure713.
•	March 5: Fed Chair Powell’s testimony – hawkish tilt could extend EM outflows.
Bottom Line: The IHSG’s path hinges on foreign flow reversals and BI’s response to rupiah volatility. While a technical bounce to 6,450 is plausible, sustained recovery requires global risk sentiment stabilization. Accumulate quality names (BBCA, TLKM) at distressed valuations but remain hedged against downside.
