Strategic Supply Chain Positioning and Critical Minerals: Japan's Economic Security Strategy and Implications for Indonesia
Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Japan's Economic Security Framework
As meticulously documented by Armstrong, Solís, and Urata in their 2025 paper "Economic Security and New Industrial Policy" published in the Asian Economic Policy Review, Japan exhibits persistent vulnerabilities in its supply chain resilience despite comprehensive policy initiatives. Recent analysis reveals Japan's increased dependence on China for rare earth elements—rising precipitously from 50% in 2014 to 70% in 2022—notwithstanding Beijing's tightening export controls over strategic minerals including germanium, gallium, graphite, and antimony.
This vulnerability is systematically quantified through comparative analysis of supplier concentration metrics. Japan reports substantially higher supplier concentration (defined by Herfindahl-Hirschman Index above 50) compared to G7 averages across multiple critical sectors:

Machinery: Japan 148 vs. G7 12
Organic chemical goods: Japan 141 vs. G7 30
Rare earths and metals: Japan 86 vs. G7 12
Electric products: Japan 79 vs. G7 12

According to the Mitsubishi Research Institute's analysis, computation of import sources for ten specified critical materials designated under the Economic Security Promotion Act (ESPA) reveals China's dominant position across multiple categories. China represents the primary source of imports for fertilizers (42%), machine tools and industrial robots (30%), rechargeable batteries (52%), and ship parts (22%). Additionally, China ranks second in permanent magnets (36%), semiconductors and integrated circuits (16%), and metallic minerals (13%).
The International Energy Agency further confirms that China maintains an extraordinary dominance in processing critical minerals, accounting for 70% of global rare earth elements production and an overwhelming 90% of processing capacity—a bottleneck of particular strategic concern.
Japan's Strategic Responses and Policy Implementation
Japan's response to these supply chain vulnerabilities is multifaceted, comprising both defensive mechanisms and proactive industrial policies:

The Economic Security Promotion Act (ESPA) establishes supply chain resilience as its first pillar, with specific provisions for government identification of essential products susceptible to foreign exploitation and subsidization of corporate sustainability planning.
Japanese firms' survey responses indicate implementation of varied supply chain risk management strategies:

Inventory buffer enhancement: 58.2% (semiconductors), 51.3% (critical minerals)
Production site/procurement source diversification: 50.9%, 53.9%
Product design reconfiguration: 30.9%, 17.9%
Material recycling initiatives: 10.0%, 14.1%


According to JCCI survey data, Japanese firms are pursuing diverse supply chain reconfiguration strategies:

"Friendshoring" (27.5%)
Reshoring to Japan (32.6%)
Further globalization (30.5%)

Indonesia's Strategic Position in Japan's Economic Security Framework
Indonesia's resource endowments and manufacturing capacity position it advantageously within Japan's evolving economic security strategy:
Critical Minerals Resources as Strategic Leverage
Indonesia's abundant nickel reserves—containing approximately 21% of global reserves—represent a significant opportunity within Japan's supply chain diversification imperative. With Japan's increased rare earth dependence on China (from 50% in 2014 to 70% in 2022), Indonesia emerges as a potential alternative supplier in Japan's mineral security strategy.
Japan's persistent vulnerabilities in rare earths and metals (HHI concentration index of 86 compared to G7 average of 12) creates strategic openings for Indonesia to position itself within Japan's "strategic autonomy" framework. This alignment is particularly relevant given Beijing's documented tightening of export controls over strategic minerals including germanium, gallium, graphite, and antimony.
Japan's Strategic Imperative to Reduce Chinese Dependency
[INSERT FIGURE 2: Share of China in overall FDI for Japan and the United States (%), showing trends in both outflows and stock positions]
Japan has explicitly adopted a policy objective to systematically reduce dependency on China across multiple dimensions of economic interaction. This imperative is central to Japan's "strategic autonomy" doctrine articulated by the LDP in 2020 and embedded in subsequent policy frameworks. Economic data reveals the tangible manifestation of this strategic shift in Japanese investment patterns, with FDI outflows to China declining precipitously from their peak of 18.9% of total Japanese outflows in 2004 to a mere 2.1% in 2023.
Multiple drivers underpin this strategic recalibration, including:

Beijing's increasing deployment of economic leverage for geopolitical purposes (exemplified by the 2010 rare earth minerals embargo)
Rising production costs within China eroding comparative advantages
Intensifying US-China technological competition creating compliance risks for Japanese firms with global operations
COVID-19 pandemic exposures of concentrated supply chain vulnerabilities
Japan's identification of specific product categories with excessive dependency, including electronic components and critical minerals

While Japan is not pursuing comprehensive economic decoupling from China, it is systematically implementing a calibrated "de-risking" strategy that targets specific vulnerability points in critical supply chains. This measured approach aims to maintain beneficial economic engagement with China while establishing greater resilience against potential supply disruptions or economic coercion.
Manufacturing Diversification and Supply Chain Reconfiguration
Recent corporate survey data indicating significant pursuit of "friendshoring" (27.5%) and "further globalization" (30.5%) strategies by Japanese firms suggests Indonesia's potential as a destination for manufacturing investment seeking to reduce concentration risks. This opportunity is amplified by Japan's documented concerns regarding overdependence on China for products including:

Laptop PCs (99.4%)
Mobile telephones (83.7%)
Photovoltaic semiconductor devices (66.6%)
Lithium-ion batteries (66.1%)

The observed Japanese FDI trends create potential openings for Indonesia to capture redirected Japanese investment within reorganized supply chains.
Raw Materials Processing Advancement Opportunities
China's dominance in critical minerals processing (90% of rare earths processing globally according to IEA data) illuminates a strategic convergence between Japan's economic security objectives and Indonesia's downstream industry development goals. Japan's substantial industrial subsidies (3.9 trillion yen over three years) suggests potential for Indonesia to attract Japanese technical expertise for advancing processing capabilities that would simultaneously serve Japan's strategic autonomy objectives.
This potential alignment is reinforced by recent economic research suggesting efficacy of well-designed industrial policies particularly for upstream sectors. Indonesia's position in the industrial value chain for critical minerals essential to clean energy technologies corresponds directly with Japan's identification of renewable energy components as strategically important under the Economic Security Promotion Act (ESPA).
Implementation Considerations and Institutional Architecture
Realizing Indonesia's strategic potential within Japan's economic security framework requires attention to several implementation dimensions:

Institutional Framework Development: Japan's rapid institutional formalization—including dedicated economic security divisions within MOFA and METI, specialized teams within the National Security Secretariat, and a full-fledged Economic Security Bureau—provides models for Indonesia to develop complementary institutional capacities.
Public-Private Coordination: The significant divergence in economic security implementation based on organizational scale (56.5% of SMEs have implemented no economic security policies) parallels challenges in Indonesia's business ecosystem, suggesting potential for shared capacity-building initiatives.
Multilateral Framework Alignment: Japan's systematic embedding of its economic security agenda within frameworks including the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework's Supply Chain Resilience pillar creates opportunities for Indonesia to strengthen economic security cooperation through established multilateral channels.

The current transformation of global supply chains presents a strategic window for Indonesia to position itself within Japan's evolving economic security architecture, particularly in critical minerals and supply chain reconfiguration initiatives that align with both nations' strategic imperatives amid intensifying geopolitical competition.
