Okay, I've updated the "Key Insights" section to emphasize the efficiency gains for both individuals and teams using AI, including both the 16.4% and 12.7% figures.

Title: AI as Teammate: Boosting Productivity & Reshaping Work
Subtitle: Beyond the Tool – 3 Key Insights on How GenAI Acts as Your Cybernetic Collaborator

Key Insights:

1. AI as Teammate: GenAI functions beyond a simple tool, acting as a "cybernetic teammate" that replicates key aspects of human collaboration.
2. Productivity Surge: AI significantly boosts efficiency, with individuals completing tasks 16.4% faster and teams 12.7% faster, while matching quality benchmarks.   
3. Expertise Unleashed: AI breaks down traditional knowledge silos, empowering individuals to perform tasks outside their core expertise and balancing functional perspectives.
Work Experience Enhanced: Contrary to expectations, AI use leads to increased positive emotions (like excitement) and decreased negative ones (like frustration) among workers.
Rethink Collaboration: Findings necessitate a strategic review of team structures, workflow designs, and skill development for the AI-augmented workplace.
1. AI Boosts Performance, Matches Human Teams

The experiment, based on a field study with 776 professionals at Procter & Gamble, compared four distinct groups: individuals and two-person teams working either with or without GenAI assistance (See [Figure 1, Treatment Matrix] for the experimental setup). This design revealed a clear hierarchy in solution quality across the different work setups. While individuals working alone without AI formed the baseline, traditional two-person teams (R&D + Commercial) showed modestly better performance, validating standard assumptions about collaborative benefits.

However, the introduction of GenAI dramatically shifted this landscape:

AI Empowers Individuals: Individuals using AI produced solutions 0.37 standard deviations higher in quality than the baseline, a significant uplift. Strikingly, their performance was statistically comparable to that of two-person teams working without AI. This suggests AI can effectively substitute for certain collaborative functions, allowing individuals to achieve team-level quality. See: [Figure 2, Average Solution Quality] & [Figure 3, Pairwise Density Comparisons]   
Efficiency and Depth: AI users were not only better but faster. Individuals with AI spent 16.4% less time on the task than the control group, while AI-assisted teams were 12.7% faster. Despite this speed, AI-generated solutions were substantially longer and more comprehensive. See: [Figure 4, Time Saved] & [Figure A1, Length of Solutions Produced]   
Driving Top-Tier Innovation: AI, especially when combined with human teamwork (Team + AI), significantly increased the chances of producing exceptional results. AI-augmented teams were roughly three times more likely than individuals without AI to generate solutions ranked in the top 10% by quality, highlighting a potential synergy for breakthrough innovation.
