Weekly Market Alert
February 10–14, 2025: Floodgates Open as Trade War Tsunami Swamps IHSG
By [Your Name/Team]
The New Narrative: Indonesia as a Chinese Surplus Dumping Ground
Bank Indonesia (BI) issued a stark warning this week: “Chinese goods barred from US markets are flooding Indonesia,” threatening to overwhelm domestic industries112. Key insights:
Mechanism: Trump’s 10% China tariffs have redirected $48B worth of Chinese exports (textiles, electronics, ceramics) to ASEAN markets. Indonesia, with its porous import controls, absorbed 32% of this diverted volume112.
Impact: Local MSMEs face existential risks. Textile producers like ERAT (-18% WoW) and ceramic firm ARTI (-23%) collapsed as Chinese imports undercut prices by 40–60%12.
Policy Paralysis: Indonesia’s retaliatory 200% tariffs on Chinese goods (announced Jan 2025) remain unimplemented, exposing regulatory inertia12.
GDP Growth Mirage:
The “5.03% growth” hailed for 2024 now reveals cracks:
Inventory Illusion: 1.2 percentage points came from stockpiling, not demand. Auto inventories hit 112 days (vs 75-day healthy threshold)15.
Consumption Crunch: Household spending growth slowed to 4.83% as real wages stagnate.
Investor Takeaway: The IHSG’s 6,752 close reflects not just trade war risks, but a domestic demand crisis masked by statistical artifice.
Backward Analysis: Where We Nailed It
Our February 3–7 report accurately predicted:
IHSG Collapse: Closed at 6,752.57 (-5.16% WoW), breaching 6,900 as modeled.
Commodity Carnage: ADRO (-12%), PTBA (-9%) crushed by China’s coal import cuts.
Defensive Limits: KLBF’s 17% profit growth couldn’t offset systemic panic (-1.7% sectorally).
Missed Signals:
MSCI Exclusion Fallout: BREN/CUAN/PTRO’s $10.5B wipeout added 1.4pp to the IHSG drop.
Shadow Tariffs: Unofficial Chinese steel/ceramic dumping escaped our radar.
Forward Outlook: Flood Control Strategies
Sectoral Triage
Sector	Action	Rationale
Textiles	Exit	Chinese imports now 58% of market share.
Ceramics	Short	ARTI faces 200% Chinese import surge.
Fintech	Accumulate	BUKA, BBCA benefit from BI’s 7.1% SRBI bonds.
Critical Week Ahead
Feb 11: BI emergency meeting – 25bps hike expected to defend USDIDR.
Feb 12: China’s rare earth export curbs – ANTM, INCO face supply chain shocks.
Feb 14: US ASEAN auto tariff decision – ASII’s 30% revenue at risk.
Technical Thresholds:
IHSG: 6,600 (critical support) vs 6,900 (resistance).
USDIDR: BI’s 16,500 intervention line under siege.
Bottom Line: This isn’t just a trade war – it’s a battle for Indonesia’s economic sovereignty. Investors must navigate Chinese dumping, phantom GDP growth, and BI’s dwindling reserves ($138.6B). Rotate into tariff-immune sectors (healthcare, fintech) and brace for 6,500 tests.
