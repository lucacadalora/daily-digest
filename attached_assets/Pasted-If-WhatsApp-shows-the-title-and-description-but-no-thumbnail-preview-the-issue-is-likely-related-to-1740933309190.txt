If WhatsApp shows the title and description but no thumbnail preview, the issue is likely related to the og:image tag or WhatsAppâ€™s caching. Try these fixes:

âœ… 1. Ensure the og:image Meta Tag is Correct
Check that your page includes this tag:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg">
The image must be publicly accessible (test by opening in incognito mode).
Use a direct URL (not a CDN or dynamically generated link).
Avoid redirects â€“ WhatsApp doesnâ€™t like them.
âœ… 2. Ensure Image Meets WhatsApp Requirements
WhatsApp is picky about image formats and sizes:

Minimum Size: 300Ã—200 pixels
Recommended Size: 1200Ã—630 pixels
Max File Size: 5MB
Format: PNG or JPEG (avoid WebP, SVG, or GIF)
Aspect Ratio: 1.91:1 (landscape)
âœ… 3. Check WhatsApp Debug Tool (Trick)
WhatsApp doesnâ€™t have a debug tool, but you can try:

Send the link to yourself in WhatsApp.
Then forward it to another chat (sometimes this forces WhatsApp to re-fetch metadata).
Try changing the URL slightly when sending (e.g., add ?v=2):

âœ… 4. Verify Image Accessibility
Test if WhatsApp can access your image by using:

sh
Copy
Edit
curl -I https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg
If it returns a 403 Forbidden or 404 Not Found, your image is blocked. Make sure:

The image isnâ€™t restricted by robots.txt or CORS policies.
It doesnâ€™t require authentication (should be public).
Your server correctly serves Content-Type: image/jpeg or image/png.
âœ… 5. Force WhatsApp to Refresh
If WhatsApp cached an old version:

Modify the URL slightly (e.g., add ?v=3 at the end of the image URL).
Rename the image file (WhatsApp wonâ€™t update if the filename is the same).
Example:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta property="og:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg?v=3">
