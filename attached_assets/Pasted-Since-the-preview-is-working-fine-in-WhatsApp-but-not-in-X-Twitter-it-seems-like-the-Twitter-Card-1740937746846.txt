Since the preview is working fine in WhatsApp but not in X (Twitter), it seems like the Twitter Card meta tags might not be set up correctly or Twitter may not be refreshing the cached metadata.

Here's how to fix it for X (Twitter):
1. Ensure Twitter Card Tags are Present
Twitter uses its own set of meta tags called Twitter Cards. Make sure these tags are included in your HTML:

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="China's Steel Sector Seized by Talk of 'Supply Reform 2.0'">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="World's biggest supplier needs an overhaul to cut production. Beijing may order 50 million tons of capacity cuts: Citigroup">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg">
<meta name="twitter:url" content="https://lucaxyzz-digest.replit.app/latest/china-steel-reform">
twitter:card: summary_large_image to ensure a large thumbnail.
twitter:title and twitter:description: These should match the title and description you want to display.
twitter:image: Ensure it points to the correct image URL.
2. Test Using Twitter Card Validator
Use the Twitter Card Validator to check if Twitter is reading the correct metadata.

Paste your URL.
Click Preview Card.
This will help you see what data Twitter is pulling.
3. Force Refresh Twitter's Cache
If Twitter is not updating its preview, it might be due to cached metadata. You can:

Add a query parameter to the image URL (e.g., ?v=2):

html
Copy
Edit
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourwebsite.com/path-to-image.jpg?v=2">
This helps Twitter fetch the updated metadata.

Re-submit your link in the Twitter Card Validator to force Twitter to rescrape it.

4. Ensure Image Size and Accessibility
Twitter requires images to be:

At least 600x314px (recommended 1200x630px).
Publicly accessible (test by visiting the image URL directly in an incognito window).
If the image is blocked by permissions (like CORS or robots.txt), Twitter won't be able to fetch it.

5. Check Twitter Caching
If Twitter still isn't showing the preview correctly, it might take some time for the cache to refresh. You can try posting the link again after a few hours, as Twitter may need to update its cache for the link.

Summary:
Make sure Twitter Card tags are in place.
Test using Twitter Card Validator.
Force Twitter to scrape the page by adding a query to the URL.
Check the image size and accessibility.
