1. Route Redirection for Twitter Card (t/steel and t/jpg)
You're using a route to redirect requests to the actual HTML files for Twitter card testing.
This setup seems correct, but since Twitter often caches previews for a long time, ensure your routes are not redirecting in a way that causes metadata issues.
Possible Issue: If you’re redirecting to static pages like twitter-steel.html and jpg-test.html, make sure that Twitter's crawler can access those pages directly. If there are any redirects or caching issues, this might prevent Twitter from properly fetching and updating the preview.

Suggestions:

Make sure the redirection is working without delay or issues by testing your /t/steel and /t/jpg routes directly (outside of Twitter).
Use the Twitter Card Validator to test the page URLs directly and see if Twitter is pulling the correct meta tags.
2. Caching and Image Serving (china-steel.png)
You're caching the image for different durations based on whether a v query parameter is included.
Strong caching for versioned requests (?v=5) is a good strategy, but you need to ensure that Twitter and other social media platforms can see the updated image when it's shared.
Possible Issue: Twitter might not be fetching the correct image or is caching the old image for too long. This can occur if the image is cached and not updated.

Suggestions:

Try forcing Twitter to refresh its cache by using the Twitter Card Validator and checking if the updated image (?v=5) is being picked up correctly.
If possible, change the image URL slightly (e.g., change the version number in ?v=5 to ?v=6) to ensure that Twitter pulls the latest version.
Check if the image is publicly accessible by visiting the direct URL for china-steel.png. Ensure that there are no permissions issues, like CORS or blocked access.
3. Ensure Meta Tags Are Correct
Your Twitter Card and Open Graph tags look correct, but ensure that they are served properly with the /t/steel or /t/jpg pages.

Possible Issue: If these meta tags are set correctly but Twitter is still not picking them up, it may be because:

The meta tags are not being parsed correctly on the live page.
Redirections or caching might prevent Twitter from accessing the correct tags.
Suggestions:

Double-check the live page by directly inspecting the HTML source or using the Twitter Card Validator.
Use strong cache control headers on your pages to avoid any issues with outdated data.
4. Debugging and Logs
It’s a good idea to check the logs in your app to see if any errors are occurring while serving the images or meta tags.

Suggestions:

Ensure that the image path is correct, and the image is being served properly by the server.
Log all requests to the /t/steel and /t/jpg endpoints and check for any redirection or error logs in the console.
5. Verify Meta Tags Are Actually Served
You can manually inspect the rendered HTML by visiting your page (not via Twitter) and checking if the following meta tags appear:

html
Copy
<meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:title" content="China Steel Reform 2.0">
<meta name="twitter:description" content="World's biggest supplier needs an overhaul to cut production. Beijing may order 50 million tons of capacity cuts.">
<meta name="twitter:image" content="https://lucaxyzz-digest.replit.app/latest/china-steel.png?v=5">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://lucaxyzz-digest.replit.app/latest/china-steel.png?v=5">
You can do this by right-clicking the page and selecting "View Page Source" or using browser developer tools to check the meta tags in the <head> section.

Next Steps
Test your Twitter Card pages directly with the Twitter Card Validator.
Make sure the image is publicly accessible and updated.
Check logs for any issues during image serving or redirection.
Try force refreshing the metadata by adding versioning to the image URL (?v=6) and testing again on Twitter.
